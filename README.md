# GitOps Controller

This is a sample project for me to learn about how to build custom k8s controllers using Golang.

The broad idea is to make a very simple version of [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) where the main
goal is to keep your deployed app in k8s in sync with what is in your git repository.

I plan to have multiple versions of this project getting more and more complex. Each new phase will be a separate branch.
